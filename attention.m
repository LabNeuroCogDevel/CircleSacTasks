%% paradigmn is "Aim 1"  of "P5"
% The overarching goal of P5 is to measure cortical activation and functional connectivity in antipsychotic-naïve, 
% first-episode psychosis patients and matched controls performing tasks that require attention and working 
% memory. We will employ a concurrent multimodal imaging approach combining fMRI, for high spatial 
% resolution, with MEG and EEG (M/EEG), for high temporal resolution. We will be attentive to patterns of 
% activation throughout the cortex but will focus, in accordance with the Center's goals, on V1, PPC and DLPFC. 
% To test the hypothesis that functional connectivity between PPC and DLPFC is impaired in schizophrenia, we 
% will employ spectral measures of coherence and causality (M/EEG) and analogous measures of slow temporal 
% co-variation (fMRI). To test the hypothesis that impairments increase along a posterior-to-anterior axis, we will 
% measure the strength of activation during task performance in V1, PPC and DLPFC. 

% To investigate attentional impairments in first-episode schizophrenia. We will assess regional 
% activity and interregional functional connectivity in patients with first-episode schizophrenia and matched 
% controls performing tasks that place a variable demand on attention. We predict that:  
%  1) Performance of subjects with schizophrenia will be impaired. The impairment will be most prominent under 
%     conditions imposing the greatest demand on attention.  
%  2) Cortical activation associated with attention will be reduced in schizophrenia. The disease effect will 
%     increase across areas in the order V1 to PPC to DLPFC. 
%  3) Functional connectivity between DLPFC and PPC associated with attention will be reduced in 
%     schizophrenia. The reduction will be most prominent for measures found in P4 to depend on layer 3.

% Aim 1: Attention. 
% Patients and healthy controls will perform, in separate blocks, 
% three tasks that impose graded degrees of 
% challenge on top-down attention. In order of increasing challenge, these 
% are a visual pop-out task in "habitual"? 
% mode, a visual search task in "habitual" mode and a visual search task 
% in "flexible"? mode. The trial structure will 
% be the same regardless of task (Fig. 5.1). After the 
% appearance of a central cross, on which the subject 
% must fixate, a color cue appears briefly at fixation. 
% This instructs the subject that it will be necessary 
% later in the trial to direct attention to a peripheral item 
% of the same color. After a brief delay, a probe array 
% appears, encompassing a target and five distractors 
% at equal eccentricity in a hexagonal arrangement. All 
% six items are annuli. Each annulus has a gap on 
% either its left or right side. The subject has two 
% seconds in which to direct attention to the target, 
% take note of the location of the gap and respond with 
% a left or right button press depending on whether the 
% gap is located on the left or right side of the target. 
% The size of the gap will be adjusted during preliminary 
% testing so as to ensure that performance requires covert 
% attention. 
%
% Each task has distinctive properties that determine the degree of challenge to top-down attention. Pop-out task 
% in "habitual" mode. On a given block of trials, the color cue and the target will always be of one color (green in 
% Fig.5.1) and the distractors will all be of the same color, which will be the same from trial to trial (red in Fig.5.1). 
% Thus the target can be selected for attention in a top-down fashion, on the basis of its matching the antecedent 
% cue in color, but top-down selection subject to aid by two bottom-up processes, namely habit (the habit 
% developed across the block of attending to a certain color) and automatic capture of attention by an item salient 
% due to its perceptual oddball status. Visual search task in "habitual" mode. In this task, the target will be of the 
% same color across the entire block of trials but the distractors on any given trial will be of multiple colors. Thus 
% the target can be selected for attention in a top-down fashion, on the basis of its matching the antecedent cue 
% in color, but top-down selection is subject to aid by a bottom-up process, namely habit (the habit developed 
% across the block of attending to a certain color). Visual search task in "flexible" mode. In this task, both the 
% target and the distractors will vary in color from trial to trial. Thus the target must be selected for attention in a 
% top-down fashion, on the basis of its matching the antecedent cue in color, without any reliance on bottom-up 
% aids. The three tasks will be run in interleaved blocks for a total of 480 trials. 
% Attention hypothesis 1. The performance of subjects with schizophrenia will be impaired. The impairment will 
% be most prominent under conditions imposing the greatest demand on attention.  
% Attention hypothesis 2. Cortical activation associated with attention will be reduced in schizophrenia. The 
% disease effect will increase across areas in the order V1 to PPC to DLPFC. 
% Attention hypothesis 3. Functional connectivity between DLPFC & PPC associated with attention will be 
% reduced in schizophrenia. The reduction will be most prominent for measures found in P4 to depend on layer 
% 3.
