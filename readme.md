# Using

Both `workingMemory` and `attention` have similar invocations. Neither require any arguments, but can take `ID`, `sex`, and `age` (each followed by their value). There are also argument flags: `r` ( *r*esume subject info without prompting), `fMRI` (cumulative timing with timing files), and `MEG` (randomly generate events and reset timing each trial).

`workingMemory` can take an additional argument flag, `normalkeys` or `reversekeys`, to counterbalance the "same" and "different" key presses.
When any of the arguments are not given, their value will be assigned by prompt.

*NOTE:* `reversekeys` and `normalkeys` are only parsed for the first block. Even if they are specified differently for subsequent blocks, they will be ignored.


```matlab
%% examples
% the simplest working memory invocation
workingMemory
% the most involved
workingMemory MEG reversekeys ID subjID sex m age 99 r block 1


%% intended flow
attention ID 0001WF r block 1
% ... fill in sex and age
% push up to get previous line, change 1 to 2
attention ID 0001WF r block 2
```

# Timing

Working Memory timing is generated with `timing/mk1d.pl`. Attention uses `timing/mk1dAttention.pl`. Picking the top 6 is done by `timing/getBestWorkingMemory.bash` and `timing/getBestAttentionTiming.bash`

# Documentation 

see `docs/`

* `docs/ccnmd 2013 application.pdf` `pg. 66` starts the description of the two tasks


# Debuging and Testing
## Testing
largely incomplete unit tests are in 

  * `MEGTest.m`
  * `PdgmTest.m`

e.g. `res = run(MEGTest,'testWM')`

## Debuging
the number of blocks, trials per block, and timing file(s) can be forced using the arguments `nblocks`, `tpb`, and `testfile`.

```matlab
% run WM block 3 of 6 with 3 trials
workingMemory tpb 3 nblocks 6 block 3
% two blocks of the same timing, need tpb to enter TEST mode
attention tpb 0 nblocks 2 testfile private_testing/attentionTiming.txt testfile private_testing/attentionTiming.txt 
```

## Navigating the code
### Shared
| file/function   | desc. |
|-----------------| ------|
| `setupScreen.m` | creates psychtoolbox screen object to draw on |
| `sendCode.m`    | sends trigger code |
| `drawBorder.m`  | provides a method to draw a frame around the screen |
| `clearAndWait.m`| waits for input, optionally clears the screen at some time point|

### Attention
Run task with `attention.m`

* `attention.m`      runs a block of trials saving after each trial and each block (uses `attentionTrial.m`)
* `attentionTrial.m` runs an individual trial
* `drawRing.m`       used for cue, attention, and probe trial events, can return directions and colors of each annulus
* `fixation.m`       draws a center fixation at a provided time

### Working Memory
* `workingMemory.m`      runs a block of trials saving after each trial and each block (uses `attentionTrial.m`)
* `wmTrial.m`            runs an individual trial
