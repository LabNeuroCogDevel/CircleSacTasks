# Tasks 

## Attention 

Run task with `attention.m`

* `attention.m`    runs trials with invocations of `attentionTrial.m` which exploits the many options of `drawRing.m`
* `setupScreen.m`  creates psychtoolbox screen object to draw on
* `fixation.m`     draws a center fixation at a provided time
* `sendCode.m`     sends trigger code
* `clearAndWait.m` is the shell of a function that waits for a saccade and clears the screen after a fixed time increment
* `drawBorder.m`   provides a method to draw a frame around the screen. This would add support for a photodiode
