# TODO
## MEG
 * check for working sound. The WM left/right audio cues may not play well
 * measure screen dimensions and distance to subject for degree size accuracy
 * set button glove keys
 * find working size changing border to activate photodiode

# Using

## Example
```matlab
%% examples
% the simplest working memory invocation
workingMemory 
% involved invocations
workingMemory MEG reversekeys ID subjID sex m age 99 r block 1
workingMemory fMRI normalkeys ID subjID sex m age 99 r block 2 bOrder 1:5:3:2:4:6
% testing 
workingMemory HOSTNAME Admin_PC feedback reversekeys ID subjID sex m age 99 r block 1


%% intended flow
attention ID 0001WF r practice
% ... fill in sex and age
attention ID 0001WF r block 1
% ... fill in sex and age
% push up to get previous line, change 1 to 2
attention ID 0001WF r block 2
```

## Keys/ButtonBox

| Modality| Scanner| Left   | Right |
| ------- | --     |  ---   |  ---  |
| fMRI    |  `=`   |  `7`   | `2`   |
| MEG     |  NA    |   ?    |  ?    | 

## Options

Both `workingMemory` and `attention` have similar invocations. Neither require any arguments, but can take `ID`, `sex`, and `age` (each followed by their value). There are also argument flags: `r` ( *r*esume subject info without prompting), `fMRI` (cumulative timing with timing files), and `MEG` (randomly generate events and reset timing each trial). Alternatively, `HOSTNAME host` where host is e.g. `Admin_PC`, `PUH1DMEG03` can be used to get the settings used by that computer. There is also the option for `practice`, which will run a truncated version and save the output under a different name. Feedback can be set with either `nofeedback` and `feedback`. Defaults to no feedback unless `practice`.

`workingMemory` can take an additional argument flag, `normalkeys` or `reversekeys`, to counterbalance the "same" and "different" key presses.
When any of the arguments are not given, their value will be assigned by prompt.

*NOTE:* `reversekeys` and `normalkeys` are only parsed for the first block. Even if they are specified differently for subsequent blocks, they will be ignored.


# Feedback

The white ITI cross is colored briefly to give feedback.

| color | meaning   |
| ----  | --------  |
| green | correct   |
| blue  | incorrect |
| red   |no response|

 * In *MEG* feedback, is display for only one screen flip. 
 * In the *fMRI* presentation, the feedback cross is shown for the remander of the RT window.

# Trials

see `eventTypes = ` line in [`attention.m`](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/CircleSacTasks/blob/master/attention.m#L136) and [`workingMemory.m`](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/CircleSacTasks/blob/master/workingMemory.m#L79)

## MEG

|Task      |runs| trials |
|----------|----| -------|
|Attention | 6  |    75  |
|WM        | 6  |    100 |

One attention run includes only trials of one type (pop,hab, or flex).

## fMRI

|Task      |runs| trials | full| catch|
|----------|----| -------|-----|------|
|Attention | 2  |     72 |  48 | 24   |
|WM        | 2  |     48 |  32 | 16   |


One attention run includes all pop,habit,and flex separate by miniblock breaks.


# Timing
ITI is .5 for MEG
## Att 

| fix | cue | att | probe | blank      |
| --- | --- | --- | ----- | -----      |
| ITI | .5  | .5  | .5    | 1.5 (RT)   |

## WM

| fix | cue | mem | delay | change |
| --- | --- | --- | ----- | -----  |
| ITI | .5  | 1   | 1 (1 and 3 in fMRI)  | 2 (RT) |

## fMRI

WM fMRI also has a short (1s) and a long (3s) delay, both occuring in full trials 16 times each (4 catch trials with each).

### Attention

```
TOTALTIME=306;
STARTTIME=8;
ENDTIME=16;
MINIBLOCK=15;
TOTALSCANNER=$TOTALTIME + $STARTTIME + $ENDTIME + $MINIBLOCK*2;
TR=1.5;
MEANITI=2;
MINITI=1;
TOTALTRIALS=72;
```
### WM
```
TOTALTIME=336;
STARTTIME=8;
ENDTIME=16;
TR=1.5;
MEANITI=2.5;
MINITI=1;
TOTALTRIALS=48;
TOTALSCANNER=$TOTALTIME + $STARTTIME + $ENDTIME;
```


Additional timing:

* `8s` fix before start
* `12s` fix after finish. 
* `2s` Attention `2.5s` WM mean ITI
* `2*15s` breaks within attention


### Generate
Working Memory timing is generated with `timing/mk1dWM_vardly.pl`. Attention uses `timing/mk1dAttention.pl`. Picking the top 6 is done by `timing/getBestWorkingMemory.bash` and `timing/getBestAttentionTiming.bash`

# Documentation 

see `docs/`

* `docs/ccnmd 2013 application.pdf` `pg. 66` starts the description of the two tasks


# Debuging and Testing
## Testing
largely incomplete unit tests are in 

  * `MEGTest.m`
  * `PdgmTest.m`

e.g. `res = run(MEGTest,'testWM')`

## Debuging
the number of blocks, trials per block, and timing file(s) can be forced using the arguments `nblocks`, `tpb`, and `testfile`.

```matlab
% run WM block 3 of 6 with 3 trials
workingMemory tpb 3 nblocks 6 block 3
% two blocks of the same timing, need tpb to enter TEST mode
% use fMRI with testfile, otherwise CUMMULATIVE will not be set
attention fMRI tpb 0 nblocks 2 testfile private_testing/attentionTiming.txt testfile private_testing/attentionTiming.txt 
```

## Navigating the code
### Shared
| file/function   | desc. |
|-----------------| ------|
| `setupScreen.m` | creates psychtoolbox screen object to draw on |
| `sendCode.m`    | sends trigger code |
| `drawBorder.m`  | provides a method to draw a frame around the screen |
| `clearAndWait.m`| waits for input, optionally clears the screen at some time point|

### Attention
Run task with `attention.m`

* `attention.m`      runs a block of trials saving after each trial and each block (uses `attentionTrial.m`)
* `attentionTrial.m` runs an individual trial
* `drawRing.m`       used for cue, attention, and probe trial events, can return directions and colors of each annulus
* `fixation.m`       draws a center fixation at a provided time

### Working Memory
* `workingMemory.m`      runs a block of trials saving after each trial and each block (uses `attentionTrial.m`)
* `wmTrial.m`            runs an individual trial


# Copying to Scanner

```bash
rsync  -rvhi  --exclude 'old' --exclude 'log/' --exclude 'data/' --exclude 'timing/*/stims' --exclude '.git/' . /mnt/usb/CircleSacTasks/ 
```

# Timing vs Saving
a mat file with largely redudant data is saved after every trial, leading to at times a .01 sec delay.
