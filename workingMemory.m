%% paradigmn is "Aim 2: Working Memory"  of "P5"
% Patients and controls will perform a working 
% memory task requiring retention over a short 
% interval of information concerning the location 
% and color of elements in a multi-item display. 
% The display will consist of a number of items 
% that varies from trial to trial with consequent 
% variation in the load placed on working memory. Different 
% loads will be imposed on interleaved trials. The sequence 
% of events in a trial is summarized in Fig.5.2. After 
% attainment of fixation on a central cross, subjects are 
% instructed by the pitch of an auditory cue whether to attend 
% to items in the left or right hemifield while processing an 
% upcoming multi-item display. The manipulation of attention 
% allows deconfounding lateralized effects due to mnemonic 
% processing from lateralized effects due to the location of 
% items in the display. A sample array spanning both hemifields is then presented (Memory Set in Fig. 5.2). This 
% consists of a number of colored disks. The subject must hold information about the instructed side of sample 
% array in working memory over an ensuing one-second delay. After the delay a probe array appears. The probe 
% array, with equal frequency, will be identical to the sample array with regard to the attended hemifield (match 
% condition) or will differ from it with regard to the color of one item in the attended hemifield (non-match 
% condition). Subjects are instructed to make a right button press under one condition and a left button press 
% under the other, with the pairing counterbalanced across subjects. In half of the match trials (involving no 
% change in the attended hemifield) a single item will be changed in the non-attended hemi-field to serve as a 
% catch for failure to confine attention to one hemifield as instructed. There will be three load conditions (1, 3 or 5 
% stimuli in each hemifield), with 120 trials of each load for a total of 360 trials.  
% 
% %%%% 
% 
% Working memory hypothesis 1. 
% The performance of subjects with schizophrenia will be impaired. The 
% impairment will be most prominent under conditions imposing the greatest load on working memory. 
%
% Working memory hypothesis 2. 
% Cortical activation associated with working memory will be reduced in 
% schizophrenia. The disease effect will increase across areas in the order V1 to PPC to DLPFC. 

% Working memory hypothesis 3. 
% Functional connectivity between DLPFC and PPC associated with working 
% memory will be reduced in schizophrenia. The reduction will be most prominent for measures found in P4 to 
% depend on layer 3. 
%
%
% Comment: Our expectation that cortical activation will be reduced in subjects with schizophrenia is generally 
% consistent with the existing literature. However, there are reports of increased BOLD activity for patients that 
% are often interpreted as ‘inefficient activation’ and/or a leftward shift of the inverted-U relationship between 
% brain activation and working memory load in schizophrenia. The parametric design employed in our study, 
% involving three degrees of challenge to working memory, will allow us to examine whether such effects occur.
