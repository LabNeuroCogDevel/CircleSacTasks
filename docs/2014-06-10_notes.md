# TODO
  * get MRS?
  * MEG needs ttl sending code
    * talk to shawn?


# fMRI Task Outlines
## Att

| fix | cue | att | probe | blank      |
| --- | --- | --- | ----- | -----      |
| ITI | .5 | .5 | .5 | 1.5 (if needed, RT) |

## WM

| fix | cue | mem | delay | change |
| --- | --- | --- | ----- | -----  |
| ITI | .5 | .5 | 1 | 2 (RT) |

## Runtimes

|task| runtime | runs | trials/run | trl time | notes |
|--|--|--| --| --| --|
|Att| 9.6min +1.2 catch | 2 | 48 |2+ITI |run = 16 consec. f.ea pop,hab,flex | 
|WM |12.6min +1.1 catch | 3 | 36 |3+ITI |load of 1 and 4 interleaved | 

  * \mu_ITI = 4
  * nCatch = 1/3 * trials 
     * att: 8 ⋅.5s(cue) + 8⋅ 1s(cue+att) + 16 ⋅ ITI == 1.2 min 
     * WM:  6 ⋅ 1s(cue+mem) + 6⋅ 2s(cue+mem+delay) + 12 ⋅ ITI == 1.1 min 

# ATT

  * must "block" (for habitual to be habitual)
    * each run will have all of each pop, hab, and flex group together to form 3 miniblocks within the run
  * manipulate size of gap, adjust by respone accuracy
  * ~ 18min fMRI runs
    * blocks of ~16 trials for each pop,hab,flex in run
    * 48 full trials for each across 3 runs
    * 144 full trials 
    * 4 cue catch (.5s+ITI) , 4 cue+att catch (1s+ITI)  -- 24 "trials" per run
   
  * after meeting alternative
    * 2 runs, for 32 total of each type (pop,hab,flx)


  * color changes between each miniblock for habit and pop cue
  * make sure 3 left 3 right, psudo random
  * distractor same color for whole block in pop out
  * Carol: same hab pop flex order for all
     * but argue for counterbalance orders (fatigue)



# WM

  * loads: use 1 and 4
  * interleave loads within each run
  * show mem for .5 s
  * cue: word "left"/"right", in stereo
  * instructions
    * conter-balence-- 1 same 2 diff
    * dont move eyes: lateralized -- same sensory signal in both hemis (equal MEEG signal in covert attention)
  * choose new colors, use farthest away +/- 1 so no color assocation learned
    * match lumi

  * add fast RT than 2s to ITI to keep all subj trial lengths equal

  * only 2 catch trials
     * 2/3 full 1/3 catch --> 1/6 cue+mem, 1/6 cue+mem+delay

  * timing
    * 6min/blocks for 18 min? - 24min
    * 24 full trials , 12 catch (6 cuemem 6 cuememdelay)
    * 3 runs -- 36 per load

  * randomness
    * psudo selection to min noise
       * eg match color, location


 
# ANALYSIS
  * collapse across left+right
  * fMRI 20 trials/manip. permissable
  * MEG needs 100 trials/manip
